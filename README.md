Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have been implementing R&D of complex AI projects involving NLP/NLU/NLG, knowledge graphs, knowledge representation having gathered 5+ years of experience in the Industry.

âœ… Working with various LLM models(text-embedding-ada-002, davinci, gpt-3.5, gpt-4 etc.) and libraries provided by OpenAI to help in NLP/NLG, document search tasks.

âœ… Working on exploring integration of LLMs with knowledge bases using frameworks like langchain to make LLMs more context-aware.

âœ… Working on preprocessing of products data involving understanding data patterns, constructing data cleaning/wrangling/aggregation pipelines to create product catalogues on eCommerce stores like magento.  

âœ… Worked with multiple collaborative knowledge bases like wikibase, wikidata, mediawiki, wikipedia. 

âœ… Worked with multiple ontology management tools/libraries like protege, owlready, JENA etc. 

âœ… Worked with large structured and unstructured and performed data processing using tools such as OpenRefine.

âœ… Used Data manipulation and analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy etc.

âœ… Familiar with various semantic web languages like OWL, RDFS etc.

âœ… Worked on multiple projects and made contribution using Python and JS frameworks like FastAPI, Flask, Node, Express etc.

âœ… Working on multiple kinds of databases:  SQL, NoSQL, Graph, Vector, RDF stores.
